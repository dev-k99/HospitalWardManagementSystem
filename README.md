## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server (LocalDB or full SQL Server)
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd WardSystemProject
   ```

2. **Update Connection String**
   - Open `appsettings.json`
   - Update the `WardConn` connection string to point to your SQL Server instance
   - See [Connection String Configuration](#connection-string-configuration) below for detailed options

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Connection String Configuration

The application uses a comprehensive SQL Server connection string with the following parameters:

#### **Server Configuration**
- **`Server`**: SQL Server instance name (e.g., `localhost\SQLEXPRESS` or `your-server\INSTANCE`)
- **`Database`**: Target database name (default: `WardManagementDb`)

#### **Authentication & Security**
- **`Trusted_Connection=True`**: Uses Windows Authentication (current user's credentials)
- **`TrustServerCertificate=True`**: Bypasses SSL certificate validation (development only)

#### **Timeout Settings**
- **`Connection Timeout=60`**: 60 seconds to establish initial database connection
- **`Command Timeout=60`**: 60 seconds for SQL commands to complete execution

#### **Connection Pooling**
- **`Pooling=true`**: Enables connection pooling for better performance
- **`Max Pool Size=200`**: Maximum number of connections in the pool
- **`Min Pool Size=5`**: Minimum connections kept open and ready for use

#### **Performance & Reliability**
- **`MultipleActiveResultSets=true`**: Allows multiple active result sets per connection

#### **Example Connection Strings**

**Local SQL Server Express:**
```json
"WardConn": "Server=localhost\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=WardManagementDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;Connection Timeout=60;Command Timeout=60;Max Pool Size=200;Min Pool Size=5;Pooling=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"
```

**Remote SQL Server:**
```json
"WardConn": "Server=your-server.com,1433;Database=WardManagementDb;User Id=your-username;Password=your-password;TrustServerCertificate=True;Connection Timeout=60;Command Timeout=60;Max Pool Size=200;Min Pool Size=5;Pooling=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"
```

**Azure SQL Database:**
```json
"WardConn": "Server=your-server.database.windows.net,1433;Database=WardManagementDb;User Id=your-username;Password=your-password;TrustServerCertificate=False;Encrypt=True;Connection Timeout=60;Command Timeout=60;Max Pool Size=200;Min Pool Size=5;Pooling=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: The current connection string uses `TrustServerCertificate=True` for development convenience. In production environments, use proper SSL certificates and consider SQL Authentication for better security.

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
